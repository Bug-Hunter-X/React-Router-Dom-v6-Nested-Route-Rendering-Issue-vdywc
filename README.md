This repository demonstrates a bug encountered in React Router Dom v6 where nested routes fail to render correctly. The parent route renders as expected, however, child routes defined within do not. The solution provided addresses this issue by ensuring that the nested routes are correctly defined within their parent route's element.  This is a common pitfall for developers upgrading from v5.
